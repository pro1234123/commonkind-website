A computer system is defined as a system that encompasses hardware, data, and software, and is classified into types such as supercomputers, mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers based on criteria like architecture, processing speed, memory, output device speed, number of users, and cost.
<br>
<p>The previous sections provided a fairly detailed look at the three major components of computer systems: hardware, data and software. This section takes a step back to look at the ways in which computer systems are classified. There is a wide variety of computer types. Most literature, however, distinguishes four main kinds: supercomputers, mainframes, minicomputers and microcomputers. The criteria used to categorise computer systems include:</p><br>
computer system architecture (design of internal circuitry)<br>
processing speed (measured in millions of instructions per second or MIPS)<br>
amount of main memory<br>
speed of output devices<br>
number of users<br>
cost.<br>
